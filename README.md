In this innovative project, I developed an engaging Unity-based game that integrates cutting-edge technologies like genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, and reinforcement learning to create a truly immersive gaming experience. The core objective was to implement sophisticated AI models that enhance the gameplay by enabling adaptive and intelligent agent behaviors, focusing particularly on a virtual agent's capability in complex tasks such as sphere balancing. Leveraging my expertise in C++ and Python, alongside deep learning frameworks, I successfully implemented AI models including neural networks and Q-networks. These models were crucial for training the virtual agent to perform sphere balancing, a task that requires precise control and adaptation to changing conditions within the game environment. The use of genetic algorithms allowed for optimizing the agent’s training process, exploring different strategies and mutations to improve learning efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure the virtual agent achieved optimal performance, I meticulously fine-tuned training parameters and algorithms. This included adjusting learning rates, selecting appropriate activation functions, and optimizing backpropagation techniques to refine the agent's learning curve. The iterative process of training involved deploying the models in a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline within Unity, facilitating seamless updates and enhancements to the AI’s functionality. Furthermore, the game was designed to provide an interactive learning experience for players, allowing them to engage deeply with the AI training and game dynamics. This involved creating interfaces and feedback systems that inform players about the AI’s learning progress and decision-making processes, thereby enhancing player involvement and understanding of the AI components at play. Overall, this project not only demonstrates technical expertise in integrating AI with game development but also showcases the potential of advanced machine learning techniques to create dynamic and engaging user experiences.
